# The-Impact-of-Identifier-Style-on-Source-Code-Comprehension
Program comprehension is an integral part of software development and maintenance, and it takes most of the programmersâ€™ time. A significant proportion of the source code of a software system consists of names chosen as identifiers. For this reason, identifiers are of considerable importance for the programs' readability and comprehensibility. Programmers use different identifier naming styles but, two types of them, namely camelCase and under_score styles are well-known. In this study, I investigated the correlation between identifier style preference of programmers and the accuracy to detect and recall the correct Identifier in code snippets. Additionally, I studied the impact of knowing a programming language on participants accuracy in recalling identifiers in two different styles.
